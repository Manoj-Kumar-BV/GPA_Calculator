### Tips for Testing Clickability:
1. **View in Markdown Renderer**: Make sure you're viewing this README file in a Markdown renderer (like GitHub or a Markdown viewer) rather than just a plain text editor. The links will appear clickable there.
  
2. **Hover Over Links**: When you hover over the links in a Markdown viewer, they should change appearance (typically underlined) and lead you to the specified URL when clicked.

If you're still facing issues, please double-check where you're viewing the README file and ensure it supports Markdown formatting. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
